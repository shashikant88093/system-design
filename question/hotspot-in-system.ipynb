    "# Quiz: Hot Spot Scenarios in System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which of the following scenarios could realistically introduce a hot spot in a system?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 1. The system gets a sudden surge of traffic from a particular region in the world\n",
    "\n",
    "**✔️ This can cause a hot spot.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "A hot spot occurs when a particular part of the system gets significantly more load than the rest. A sudden surge of traffic from a specific region can cause:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regional servers to overload\n",
    "- Cache warmups or invalidations for that region\n",
    "- CDN edge nodes or databases tied to that region to spike in activity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "If a ticketing site for a cricket tournament goes live, and millions of users from India try to access it simultaneously, only the servers handling Indian traffic might become hot spots due to uneven load.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ 2. A system's load balancer uses a round robin server selection strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ This generally doesn't cause a hot spot (on its own).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "A **round robin** load balancing strategy distributes incoming requests evenly across all backend servers in a rotating fashion. It’s **designed** to **prevent hot spots**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **if the backend servers differ in capacity**, then round robin may unintentionally overload weaker servers — but **round robin itself** is **not a direct cause** of a hot spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (not a hot spot):**  \n",
    "If there are 5 servers and 100 requests, each server gets 20 requests — evenly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 3. The asynchronous replication of a system's primary database fails\n",
    "\n",
    "**✔️ This can cause a hot spot.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "If the **asynchronous replica fails**, all read or write traffic may be **rerouted to the primary** database. This puts sudden extra pressure on one node (the primary), creating a **hot spot at the database layer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- You have a primary DB and 2 replicas used for reading.  \n",
    "- If the replicas go down, all reads hit the primary.  \n",
    "- The primary DB gets overwhelmed, slowing down the entire system — classic hot spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 4. A new social media trend encourages everyone named Alex or Alexa to tweet hello\n",
    "\n",
    "**✔️ This can cause a hot spot — depending on how your system stores or indexes data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "If your system **indexes or shards** user data by **username or first name**, and suddenly **millions of users named Alex or Alexa** perform the same action, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All related records or database partitions for “Alex/Alexa” will be overwhelmed.\n",
    "- You’ll see a **skewed access pattern** — leading to hot spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Let’s say you hash usernames to assign them to database partitions:  \n",
    "- All usernames starting with “A” go to Partition 1  \n",
    "- A massive number of Alex/Alexa users tweeting at once → Partition 1 spikes → hot spot\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

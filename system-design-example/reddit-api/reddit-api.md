Certainly! Here's a comprehensive summary of the provided question prompt and the solution walkthrough details for designing the Reddit API focused on subreddits, posts, comments, votes, and awards.

### Question Prompt
Design an API for Reddit subreddits to support the following core functionalities:
- Users can write posts.
- Users can comment on posts.
- Users can upvote or downvote posts and comments.
- Users can award posts and comments.

**Key Entities**:
1. **User**
   - `userId: string`
   - Other fields not defined for this design.
  
2. **SubReddit**
   - `subredditId: string`
   - Other fields not defined for this design.

Focus on the primary functionalities without auxiliary features like sharing, reporting, or moderating.

### Solution Walkthrough

#### 1. **Gathering Requirements**
The core functionality to be designed is focused on:
- Writing posts in subreddits.
- Commenting on those posts.
- Voting on both posts and comments.
  
**Entities Defined**:
- **Posts**
- **Comments**
- **Votes**
- **Awards**

#### 2. **Plan**
The major components of the API design are outlined, considering whether to store votes as separate entities or attach them to posts/comments. A decision is made to keep votes as separate entities for easier tracking and modification.

#### 3. **Posts**
**Schema** for a Post:
- `postId: string`
- `creatorId: string`
- `subredditId: string`
- `title: string`
- `description: string`
- `createdAt: timestamp`
- `votesCount: int`
- `commentsCount: int`
- `awardsCount: int`
- `deletedAt?: timestamp`
- `currentVote?: enum UP/DOWN`

**CRUD Operations**:
- `CreatePost(userId: string, subredditId: string, title: string, description: string) => Post`
- `EditPost(userId: string, postId: string, title: string, description: string) => Post`
- `GetPost(userId: string, postId: string) => Post`
- `DeletePost(userId: string, postId: string) => Post`
- `ListPosts(userId: string, subredditId: string, pageSize?: int, pageToken?: string) => (Post[], nextPageToken?)`

#### 4. **Comments**
**Schema** for a Comment:
- `commentId: string`
- `creatorId: string`
- `postId: string`
- `createdAt: timestamp`
- `content: string`
- `votesCount: int`
- `awardsCount: int`
- `parentId?: string`
- `deletedAt?: timestamp`
- `currentVote?: enum UP/DOWN`

**CRUD Operations**:
- `CreateComment(userId: string, postId: string, content: string, parentId?: string) => Comment`
- `EditComment(userId: string, commentId: string, content: string) => Comment`
- `GetComment(userId: string, commentId: string) => Comment`
- `DeleteComment(userId: string, commentId: string) => Comment`
- `ListComments(userId: string, postId: string, pageSize?: int, pageToken?: string) => (Comment[], nextPageToken?)`

#### 5. **Votes**
**Schema** for a Vote:
- `voteId: string`
- `creatorId: string`
- `targetId: string`
- `type: enum UP/DOWN`
- `createdAt: timestamp`

**CRUD Operations**:
- `CreateVote(userId: string, targetId: string, type: enum UP/DOWN) => Vote`
- `EditVote(userId: string, voteId: string, type: enum UP/DOWN) => Vote`
- `DeleteVote(userId: string, voteId: string) => Vote`

#### 6. **Awards**
**Endpoints** related to Awards:
- `BuyAwards(userId: string, paymentToken: string, quantity: int)`
- `GiveAward(userId: string, targetId: string)`

This organization of the API structure focuses on providing a clear, extendable, and interactive design model for managing a community-driven platform like Reddit, emphasizing post and comment interaction as well as user engagement through votes and awards.


The API designed for Reddit subreddits should include the following core functionalities:

### Core Functionalities of the Reddit API:

1. **Post Management**
   - **Create Post**: Allow users to create new posts in a subreddit.
   - **Edit Post**: Enable users to edit their existing posts.
   - **Get Post**: Retrieve the details of a specific post.
   - **Delete Post**: Allow users to delete their posts.
   - **List Posts**: Enable paginated retrieval of posts from a subreddit.

2. **Comment Management**
   - **Create Comment**: Allow users to comment on posts, including replies to other comments.
   - **Edit Comment**: Enable users to edit their existing comments.
   - **Get Comment**: Retrieve the details of a specific comment.
   - **Delete Comment**: Allow users to delete their comments.
   - **List Comments**: Enable paginated retrieval of comments for a specific post.

3. **Voting System**
   - **Create Vote**: Allow users to upvote or downvote posts and comments.
   - **Edit Vote**: Enable users to change their vote (e.g., from upvote to downvote).
   - **Delete Vote**: Allow users to remove their vote from a post or comment.

4. **Awards System**
   - **Buy Awards**: Enable users to purchase awards to give to posts or comments.
   - **Give Award**: Allow users to award posts or comments, enhancing user engagement.

### Additional Considerations:
- The API should handle user authentication to ensure that actions like editing or deleting posts/comments can be controlled based on user permissions.
- Paginated responses for listing posts and comments to manage large datasets efficiently.
- Return relevant information as part of each operation, such as the status of operations and updated counts for votes and awards.

These functionalities focus primarily on the core aspects of creating and managing content within subreddits, while allowing for user interactions through comments and votes.

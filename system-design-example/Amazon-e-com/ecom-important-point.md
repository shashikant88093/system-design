To properly clarify the requirements and ensure a comprehensive understanding of the system being designed for Amazon's e-commerce business, the following clarifying questions could be asked:

### Clarifying Questions to Ask

1. **User Experience and Flow**:
   - **Q**: Can you describe the primary user flow we are focusing on for this system? Are we only considering basic functionalities like searching for items, managing a cart, and placing orders?

2. **Search Functionality**:
   - **Q**: Should we include the design of a recommendation engine or any intelligent search algorithm, or should we assume a separate service handles item retrieval based on search queries?

3. **Stock Handling**:
   - **Q**: How should the system manage out-of-stock items? Should it simply prevent users from adding these items to their cart?

4. **Low Stock Management**:
   - **Q**: When multiple users are viewing the same low stock item, how should the system handle reservations? Is there a time-based reservation mechanism that we should implement during the checkout process?

5. **Order Processing**:
   - **Q**: Should we consider the details of what happens post-order submission, such as how orders are split between warehouses and dispatched, or focus only on the user’s ordering experience?

6. **Warehouse Routing**:
   - **Q**: In cases where an order can be fulfilled by multiple warehouses, how should our system determine which warehouse to assign the order to? Is there an existing service that will provide this logic?

7. **Auxiliary Features**:
   - **Q**: Are we including features like subscription services (e.g., Amazon Prime), purchasing used vs. new items, or any other auxiliary functionalities in our design?

8. **Regional Operations**:
   - **Q**: Should our design be applicable to all regional implementations of Amazon, or are we strictly focusing on amazon.com and its structure?

9. **Performance Expectations**:
   - **Q**: What are the expected performance metrics for the system? For example, how should we balance latency during item searches vs. more complex operations like order submissions?

10. **Estimated Traffic and Load**:
    - **Q**: Can you provide insights on the expected volume of users and transactions? How many concurrent users should we consider when designing our load balancing and database structures?

Here’s a comprehensive walkthrough of the solution for designing the system that powers Amazon's e-commerce business:

### 1. Gathering System Requirements
- **Core Functionality**:
  - Searching for items.
  - Adding items to a cart.
  - Submitting orders.
  - Handling out-of-stock items and low stock scenarios.
  - Assigning orders to relevant warehouses.

### 2. High-Level System Overview
- User requests and warehouse requests are load-balanced.
- Data interactions occur with a SQL database.
- System operates for the U.S. market but can be extended to other regional systems.

### 3. SQL Database Design
Six primary tables to support core functionality:
- **Items Table**: Stores all item details.
  ```
  itemId: uuid
  name: string
  description: string
  price: integer
  currency: enum
  ```

- **Carts Table**: Stores active carts.
  ```
  cartId: uuid
  customerId: uuid
  items: []{itemId, quantity}
  ```

- **Orders Table**: Storing order information.
  ```
  orderId: uuid
  customerId: uuid
  orderStatus: enum
  items: []{itemId, quantity}
  price: integer
  paymentInfo: PaymentInfo
  shippingAddress: string
  timestamp: datetime
  ```

- **Aggregated Stock Table**: Consolidates stock for user access.
  ```
  itemId: uuid
  stock: integer
  ```

- **Warehouse Orders Table**: Tracks orders sent to warehouses.
  ```
  warehouseOrderId: uuid
  parentOrderId: uuid
  warehouseId: uuid
  orderStatus: enum
  items: []{itemId, quantity}
  shippingAddress: string
  ```

- **Warehouse Stock Table**: Manages inventory in warehouses.
  ```
  itemId: uuid
  warehouseId: uuid
  physicalStock: integer
  availableStock: integer
  ```

### 4. Core User Functionality
Key user API endpoints:
- **GetItemCatalog(search)**: Users can search for items using this endpoint.
- **UpdateCartItemQuantity(itemId, quantity)**: Updates item quantity in the cart.
- **BeginCheckout() / CancelCheckout()**: Initiates or cancels the checkout process. 
- **SubmitOrder(), CancelOrder(), & GetMyOrders()**: Handles order submission, cancellation, and retrieval of user orders.

### 5. Core Warehouse Functionality
The warehouse side functionalities include:
- **Smart Order-Assignment Service**: Processes orders, splits them, and assigns to warehouses. 
- Updates relevant stock in both the **warehouse_stock** and **aggregated_stock** tables based on items and warehouse logistics.

### 6. Stock Management
- **Reservation Logic**: When a user begins the checkout, reserved items remain temporarily unavailable to others, preventing overselling.
- Items not purchased within a set timeframe (e.g., 10 minutes) automatically return to available stock.

### 7. System Interaction Flow
- User initiates actions which pass through API servers, interacting with respective tables.
- Stock is checked and reserved when necessary, and any changes to stock are accurately reflected in the respective tables to ensure data integrity.

## Overview of System Design

Gain insights into real-world system design practices.

- **Example:** Designing the backend for an e-commerce website to handle thousands of simultaneous users during a flash sale.

Understand the importance of system design in software engineering.

- **Example:** Building a payment gateway that must be secure, reliable, and available 24/7.

Learn about the trade-offs and decisions involved in designing scalable and reliable systems.

- **Example:** Choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases for a social media platform based on scalability needs.

Explore the role of system design in modern software development and its impact on user experience.

- **Example:** Optimizing the load time of a news app to improve user retention.

## Approaches to System Design

Understand different methodologies for system design, including top-down and bottom-up approaches.

- **Example:** Using a top-down approach to design a microservices architecture for a ride-sharing app.

Learn how to analyze requirements and constraints before starting the design process.

- **Example:** Gathering requirements for a video streaming service, such as bandwidth limitations and device compatibility.

Explore iterative design and prototyping as effective strategies for refining system architecture.

- **Example:** Prototyping a chat application to test scalability before full deployment.

## Key Concepts

**Performance vs. Scalability:** Understand the difference between optimizing for performance (speed and efficiency) and scalability (ability to handle increased load).

- **Example:** Improving database query speed for a banking app (performance) vs. enabling the app to support millions of users during peak hours (scalability).

**Latency vs. Throughput:** Learn how latency (delay in processing) and throughput (amount of data processed in a given time) affect system performance.

- **Example:** Reducing latency for real-time stock trading platforms vs. increasing throughput for batch processing in data analytics.

Explore how these concepts influence design decisions and trade-offs in system architecture.

- **Example:** Deciding between synchronous and asynchronous communication in a messaging system to balance latency and throughput.

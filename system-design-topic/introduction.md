# Introduction


- System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system to meet specified requirements. It focuses on organizing and structuring software and hardware systems to efficiently handle tasks, ensuring that they are scalable, reliable, and maintainable. System design is particularly important in large-scale applications, as it addresses how different parts of a system will interact with each other and how data will flow through the system.

## Key Concepts in System Design:

### Scalability:

Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out): Adding more machines to handle increased load.
Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up): Increasing the capacity of a single machine (e.g., CPU, memory).

### Reliability:

Ensuring the system is consistently operational and can recover from failures with minimal downtime.
Techniques include replication, load balancing, and automatic failover.

### Availability:

A measure of the system's uptime. High availability is achieved by minimizing points of failure, ensuring redundancy, and using distributed systems.
Latency and Throughput:

### Latency: The time it takes to process a request.

Throughput: The number of requests processed within a given time period.
Trade-offs often exist between improving latency and maximizing throughput.
Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CAP Theorem):

### Consistency: Every read receives the latest write.

Partition Tolerance: The system continues to function even when network partitions occur.
CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can achieve only two out of three: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

### Load Balancing:

Distributing incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed, improving reliability and response times.

### Caching:

Storing frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the time needed to retrieve it from a slower backend system (e.g., databases).
Examples: Memcached, Redis.
Database Design:

### Normalization vs Denormalization: Balancing between reducing redundancy and improving query performance.
SQL vs NoSQL: Choosing between structured, relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or unstructured, distributed databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
Microservices vs Monolith:

### Monolith: A single codebase handling all aspects of the system.
Microservices: A collection of loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific piece of functionality.
API Design:

Defining clear and consistent ways for different services or systems to communicate with each other.
Common types include RESTful APIs and gRPC.

### Security:

Authentication, authorization, data encryption, and protecting against common vulnerabilities such as DDoS attacks, SQL injection, etc.
Steps to Design a System:

### Requirements Gathering:

Understand what the system needs to accomplish, including functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., scalability, performance, security).
High-Level Architecture:

Define how components like databases, APIs, caching, and load balancers fit together.
Consider different architectural patterns (e.g., microservices, event-driven architecture).

### Component Design:

Break the system down into smaller, more manageable parts.
Focus on interactions between components, databases, and external systems.
Data Flow and Storage:

Plan how data will move through the system and where it will be stored.
Choose appropriate storage systems (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL databases).
Trade-offs and Bottlenecks:

Identify potential bottlenecks (e.g., single points of failure, performance issues) and address trade-offs between performance, cost, and complexity.
System design is highly iterative and tailored to specific needs, so the solutions vary based on the nature of the problem you're trying to solve.

# ðŸ’¬ ChatterMesh: Distributed Chat App Architecture

## 1. CAP Theorem

ChatterMesh balances the CAP theorem trade-offs depending on the operation:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)** | Users can send/receive messages during network partitions. Messages sync later. |
| **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)** | Critical operations like authentication and message deletion require strong consistency. |

---

## 2. Consistency Patterns

- **Weak Consistency**  
  Typing indicators and "seen" status may lag or be inaccurate.

- **Eventual Consistency**  
  Messages sent offline sync across devices once reconnected.

- **Strong Consistency**  
  Group chat message order and delivery confirmation are guaranteed using consensus protocols.

---

## 3. Availability Patterns

### Fail-over Strategies

- **Active-Active**  
  Multiple chat servers across regions handle traffic simultaneously.

- **Active-Passive**  
  Backup servers activate if primary fails.

### Replication Strategies

- **Master-Slave**  
  User profile updates go to master DB, replicated to slaves.

- **Master-Master**  
  Chat messages replicated across regions for low-latency access.

---

## 4. Availability Metrics

| Availability | Downtime per Year |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **99.9%**     | ~8.76 hours       |
| **99.99%**    | ~52.6 minutes     |

ChatterMesh targets **99.99% uptime** using load balancers, health checks, and auto-scaling.

---

## 5. Availability in Parallel vs. Sequence

- **Parallel Availability**  
  Multiple chat servers handle requests concurrently for fault tolerance and low latency.

- **Sequential Availability**  
  Message delivery acknowledgments are processed in order to maintain consistency in group chats.

---

## 6. Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Redis, Cassandra  
- **Messaging Queue**: Apache Kafka  
- **Consensus**: etcd or ZooKeeper  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana  
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes across multiple cloud regions

---

## âœ… Summary

ChatterMesh is a robust, distributed chat application designed to balance availability and consistency across global regions. It leverages modern cloud-native patterns to ensure reliability, scalability, and performance.

# Difference between long pulling and WebSockets
## Long Polling vs. WebSockets
- **Long Polling**  
  - Client sends a request to the server.
  - Server holds the request until new data is available or a timeout occurs.
  - Once data is sent, the client immediately sends a new request.
  - Suitable for applications with infrequent updates.
  - Higher latency compared to WebSockets due to repeated HTTP requests.
  - Example: Chat applications where messages are sent every few seconds.
  
- **WebSockets**  
  - Establishes a persistent connection between client and server.
  - Allows real-time, bidirectional communication.
  - Data can be sent instantly without the overhead of HTTP requests.
  - Ideal for applications requiring low latency and frequent updates.
  - Example: Online gaming or live sports updates where real-time interaction is crucial.
  - Supports features like message broadcasting and event-driven communication.
  - Example: A live chat application where users receive messages instantly without delays.
